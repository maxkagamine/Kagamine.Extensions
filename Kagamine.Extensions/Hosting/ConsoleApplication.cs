// This is set up in a similar way to WebApplication.CreateBuilder(). Another way to tackle this would have been to add
// extension methods to IHost and simply not call StartAsync(), but this approach is perhaps a bit more "correct" and
// still allows for the use of hosted services if required. Note that no matter what, we MUST build an IHost (not just
// the IServiceProvider), as EF relies on the "HostBuilt" diagnostic event to stop execution of the startup project:
