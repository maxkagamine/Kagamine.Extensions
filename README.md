# <img src="icon.png" height="38" alt="üçä" align="top" /> Kagamine.Extensions

This repository contains a suite of libraries that provide facilities commonly needed when creating production-ready applications. (As Microsoft puts it.)

## Hosting

The main attraction here is a `ConsoleApplication.CreateBuilder()` and its simplified `Run()` methods which, as WebApplication does for ASP.NET Core, tailors the [Generic Host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host) framework for console apps. Using IHost is desirable for its dependency injection, logging, and configuration setup and consistency with web apps (not to mention EF Core migrations uses it to discover the DbContext), but the out-of-box experience is mainly designed for background workers which leads to some frustrations when trying to use it for a regular executable.

Wanting to use a source generator to create the `Run()` overloads (separate delegates for varying number of DI'd services √ó returning an exit code or not √ó being async or not = lots of overloads) was my main motivation for making this its own library.

Example Program.cs:

```cs
using Kagamine.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = ConsoleApplication.CreateBuilder();

builder.Services.AddDbContext<FooContext>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IFooService, FooService>();

builder.Run((IFooService fooService, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
{
    fooService.DoStuff(cancellationToken);
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> ASP.NET Core projects include a launchSettings.json by default which sets the environment to "Development" in dev, but this [needs to be done manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments) for a console app. The easiest way in Visual Studio is to open Debug > {Project Name} Debug Properties and under Environment Variables add DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT = Development. Note that the `ASPNETCORE_` prefix won't work here, as it's not a WebApplication.

## Collections

There's currently no solution in .NET for putting a collection in a record while maintaining both immutability and value semantics. It's also sometimes necessary to have access to the underlying array for interop with APIs that do not support spans (especially for byte arrays, where copying can have a significant performance impact).

To solve this, I've created a ValueArray&lt;T&gt; type which represents a read-only array with value type semantics suitable for use in immutable records:

| Type                        | Immutable        | Value equality | To/from array w/o copying |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| T[]                         | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ                        |
| List&lt;T&gt;               | ‚ùå               | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå                        |
| ReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; | ‚úÖ<sup>1</sup>   | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå                        |
| IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;      | ‚úÖ<sup>1</sup>   | ‚ùå            | ‚ùå                        |
| ImmutableArray&lt;T&gt;<sup>2</sup> | ‚úÖ<sup>3,4</sup> | ‚ùå    | ‚úÖ<sup>3</sup>            |
| ReadOnlyMemory&lt;T&gt;     | ‚úÖ<sup>4,5</sup> | ‚ùå            | ‚ö†<sup>5</sup>             |
| **ValueArray&lt;T&gt;**     | ‚úÖ<sup>4,6</sup> | ‚úÖ            | ‚úÖ<sup>6</sup>            |

> 1. ReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt; is merely a read-only view of a List&lt;T&gt;, and IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt; is usually the List&lt;T&gt; itself.
> 2. Has a bug caused by misuse of the null suppression operator that can cause a null reference exception which won't be caught by static analysis if any code returns its `default`. (ValueArray&lt;T&gt; fixes this by treating a null array as empty, as it is also a struct.)
> 3. [ImmutableCollectionsMarshal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.immutablecollectionsmarshal?view=net-8.0) can be used to access the underlying array or create an instance backed by an existing array.
> 4. Can be modified inadvertently if a reference is held to the array used to construct it, or if the underlying buffer is accessed and passed to a method that does not treat it as read-only.
> 5. Depending on how the ReadOnlyMemory&lt;T&gt; was created, it may be possible to access the buffer using [MemoryMarshal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.memorymarshal.trygetarray?view=net-8.0), but there's no guarantee the instance is backed by an actual array, or it may represent a slice of an array (like Span&lt;T&gt;).
> 6. Supports implicit conversion from T[], and the underlying array can be accessed via explicit cast to T[].

ValueArray&lt;T&gt; supports both [collection expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/collection-expressions) and array initializers (via implicit cast):

```cs
record Song(string Title, ValueArray<string> Artists);

Song song = new("Promise", ["samfree", "Kagamine Rin", "Hatsune Miku"]);
Song song2 = song with { Artists = [.. song.Artists] /* Clone the array */ };

// These would fail if Artists were List<T>, despite the contents being identical
Assert.True(song == song2);
Assert.True(song.Artists == song2.Artists);

ValueArray<Song> songs = new[] { song, song2 };
```

It's interoperable with spans as well as APIs requiring arrays such as Entity Framework. Using a value converter, a ValueArray&lt;byte&gt; can be cast to its underlying byte[] to use as a BLOB column without the overhead of copying an array:

```cs
entity.Property<ValueArray<byte>>(x => x.Data)
    .HasColumnName("data")
    .HasConversion(model => (byte[])model, column => column);
```

When `T` is an [unmanaged type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/unmanaged-types), ValueArray&lt;T&gt; can also be marshaled to and from ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt;. This could be used, for instance, to store an array of structs in a database as an opaque blob using their binary representation.

I've created a JsonConverter that uses this to efficiently serialize a ValueArray&lt;T&gt; as a base 64 string:

```cs
ValueArray<DateTime> dates = [ DateTime.Parse("2007-08-31"), DateTime.Parse("2007-12-27") ];

var options = new JsonSerializerOptions() { Converters = { new JsonBase64ValueArrayConverter() } };
var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(dates, options); // "AIAeAnm5yQgAAN2OMhbKCA=="
```

To deserialize an array as ValueArray&lt;T&gt; (as System.Text.Json cannot natively deserialize to a custom readonly collection), use the JsonValueArrayConverter. Both converters have generic versions to mix-and-match for specific T's.

## IO

TemporaryFileProvider provides a number of advantages for working with temp files over `Path.GetTempFileName()`:

- Unlike `GetTempFileName()`, it's possible to specify a file extension or suffix, which may be necessary when passing the file path to certain programs (unlike common solutions on Stack Overflow, it guarantees that the file name is unique and avoids race conditions);
- Temp files are stored in an application-specific directory which is removed if empty when the application quits;
- The TemporaryFile can be placed in a `using` which will automatically clean up the temp file when disposed;
- TemporaryFile _doesn't_ maintain an open handle to the file, which allows for the file path to be passed to other programs like ffmpeg which may overwrite or replace the file (and expect it to not be in use);
- üëâ **Most importantly:** a method can return a FileStream backed by the temp file which automatically deletes the file when the stream is closed ‚Äî this works even when the TemporaryFile itself is in a `using`, simplifying common error handling patterns such as:

```cs
public async Task<Stream> ConvertToOpus(Stream inputStream, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    using TemporaryFile inputFile = tempFileProvider.Create();
    await inputFile.CopyFromAsync(inputStream);

    using TemporaryFile outputFile = tempFileProvider.Create(".opus");

    await FFMpegArguments
        .FromFileInput(inputFile.Path)
        .OutputToFile(outputFile.Path, overwrite: true, options => options
            .WithAudioBitrate(Bitrate))
        .CancellableThrough(cancellationToken)
        .ProcessAsynchronously();

    // If ffmpeg throws, both temp files will be deleted.
    // 
    // If it succeeds, the input file is deleted, but the output file remains on
    // disk as the returned FileStream keeps it open. When the stream is closed,
    // the remaining temp file will be cleaned up automatically.
    return outputFile.OpenRead(deleteWhenClosed: true);
}
```

## Logging

A small extension method inspired by SerilogMetrics, which I've used on a number of projects in the past:

```cs
using (logger.BeginTimedOperation(nameof(DoStuff)))
{
    logger.Debug("Doing stuff...");
}
// [12:00:00 INF] DoStuff: Starting
// [12:00:00 DBG] Doing stuff...
// [12:00:01 INF] DoStuff: Completed in 39 ms
```

## Utilities

TerminalProgressBar class which sends ANSI escape codes to display a [progress bar in the terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/progress-bar-sequences) and clear it automatically when disposed:

```cs
using var progress = new TerminalProgressBar();

for (int i = 0; i < foos.Count; i++)
{
    logger.Information("Foo {Foo} of {TotalFoos}", i + 1, foos.Count);
    progress.SetProgress(i, foos.Count);

    await fooService.DoStuff(foos[i]);
}
```

RateLimitingHttpHandler, a DelegatingHandler that uses [System.Threading.RateLimiting](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-rate-limiting-for-dotnet/) to force requests to the same host to wait for a configured period of time since the last request completed before sending a new request (run the sample ConsoleApp for a demo):

```cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<RateLimitingHttpHandler>();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient(Options.DefaultName).AddHttpMessageHandler<RateLimitingHttpHandler>();
```

## EntityFramework

`Update<T>(this DbSet<T> set, T entity, T valuesFrom)` for replacing an existing entity with a new instance, since EF will throw if you try to pass a detached entity to Update() while another instance with the same primary key is tracked (e.g. by another query performed elsewhere):

```cs
var existingEntities = await db.Foos.ToDictionaryAsync(f => f.Id);

foreach (var entity in entities)
{
    if (existingEntities.Remove(entity.Id, out var existingEntity))
    {
        db.Foos.Update(existingEntity, entity);
    }
    else
    {
        db.Foos.Add(entity);
    }
}

db.Foos.RemoveRange(existingEntities.Values);
await db.SaveChangesAsync();
```

`ToHashSetAsync<T>()`, mirroring ToArrayAsync and ToListAsync. Implemented using `await foreach`, like the other two, making it slightly more performant than doing ToListAsync then ToHashSet _(.NET 8 only; this was made official in EF 9)_:

```cs
HashSet<string> referencedFiles = await db.Foos
    .Select(f => f.FilePath)
    .ToHashSetAsync(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

foreach (var file in Directory.EnumerateFiles(dir))
{
    if (!referencedFiles.Contains(file))
    {
        logger.Warning("Deleting orphaned file {Path}", file);
        File.Delete(file);
    }
}
```
